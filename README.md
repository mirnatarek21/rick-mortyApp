# flutter_bloc

This Flutter application utilizes the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com) to fetch and display character information from the popular TV show. Additionally, it integrates the DummyJSON Quotes API (https://dummyjson.com/quotes) to display a collection of quotes dynamically.

The project is built using the Cubit state management pattern, also I used the Dio package for making API requests and Flutter Offline to provide a seamless experience even when the device is not connected to the internet.
